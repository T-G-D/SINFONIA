The following folders contain the matlab files to run in Comsol the Benchmark problem Silica Protonation (1a) and Rutile Goethite (3c).

In order to run the scripts Matlab, Comsol and the livelink module of Comsol are required. The script is presented as a model of how to implement
the coupling between the electrostatic Poisson-Boltzman equation and the (de)sorption equilibrium algebraic system. Other ways to implement the mathematical
system in Comsol are possible regarding formulation, built-in physics, and so on. 
The scripts are not a code, neither is thought to be used in that way, it is rather a guideline that can be used to help and inspire other person who want 
to do the same or similar type of simulations.

Each script ends up providing a .xlsx file with some of the results of the simulation. Easy modifications to the script should allow to get other information
and/or change the format of the provided output.

The authors would like to acknowledge the help provided by the Comsol support team.
